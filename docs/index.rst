Welcome to lmodule documentation!
===================================

`lmodule <https://github.com/HPC-buildtest/lmodule>`_ is a Python API for `Lmod <https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_
module system. lmodule was part of `buildtest <https://github.com/HPC-buildtest/buildtest-framework>`_ and we found that
a Python API for the Lmod system would benefit other's who may not need to use buildtest.

The name **lmodule** was decided by taking **Lmod** + **module** = **lmodule**.
